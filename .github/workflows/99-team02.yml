            Set up a separate Dokku instance for QA.  Adapt the instructions from 
            the file [`docs/dokku.md`](/ucsb-cs156-f23/STARTER-team02/blob/main/docs/dokku.md) in the repo.  The QA (quality assurance) instance
            starts with the main branch, but later on, you will be able to deploy
            any branch to this instance. You typically do this when you have a PR
            that is being code reviewed.  You can use the your team's Slack channel
            to coordinate who is deploying what to QA at any given time.

              In this issue, you'll create a *Controller*.  In the Spring web framework, a Controller is a file that maps request URLs (e.g. `/api/${{env.name}}/all` to some code that runs to produces the response to that request.
              
              (1) First locate the directory where the Java source code files for controllers can be found:

              (2) Then, determine which example file you are going to use as a basis for your controller by reading the team02 instructions about the `@Id` field here: <https://ucsb-cs156.github.io/f23/lab/team02.html#two-types-of-id-values-for-an-entity-class>
              
              The two candidates are:
              * `UCSBDatesController.java` (if your database table a numeric `@Id` field)
              * `UCSBDiningCommonsController.java` (if your database table uses a string field as it's `@Id` field)

              Keep this file open in one window; you'll need this as source material for the file you are about to create.

              (3) In a separate window, create a new file called `${{env.name}}Controller.java` in the `src/main/java/edu/ucsb/cs156/example/controllers` directory.
              
              From the example file, copy over:
              * all of the imports
              * the top level class annotations (e.g. `@Tag`, `@RequestMapping`, `@RestController` and `@Slf4j`) adjusting them as needed
              * the `@Autowired` declaration of the repository class for your database table; this gives you access to the database table.  The `@Autowired` declaration signals
                the Spring boot framework to automatically invoke the constructor for this class so that you don't have to.  Using `@Autowired`
                also allows the code to automatically switch between using a real database when running as a web app,
                or a "mock" database when we do unit testing of the controller methods.

              (4) Don't copy over all of the methods yet; just copy over these two methods with these annotations:
              
              | Annotation | Purpose |
              |-|-|
              | `@GetMapping("/all")`   | Get all records in the table and return as a JSON array |
              | `@PostMapping("/post")` | Use the data in the input parameters to create a new row in the table and return the data as JSON |
              
              (5) Edit the names of the fields, etc. to match your database table.

              (6) Next, use Swagger to see if your methods work.  Debug until you get correct results using Swagger.
              
              (7) When your interactive testing works, we'll move on to creating automated tests.  Locate the directory for controller tests:
              
              * [`src/test/java/edu/ucsb/cs156/example/controllers`](https://github.com/ucsb-cs156-f23/STARTER-team02/tree/main/src/test/java/edu/ucsb/cs156/example/controllers)  

              Find the file with tests for the controller you used as a basis for your controller file, 
              i.e. 

              * `UCSBDatesControllerTests.java` (if your database table a numeric `@Id` field)
              * `UCSBDiningCommonsControllerTests.java` (if your database table uses a string field as it's `@Id` field)

              Keep this file open in one window; you'll need this as source material for the file you are about to create.

              (8) In a separate window, create a new file called `${{env.name}}ControllerTests.java` in the `src/test/java/edu/ucsb/cs156/example/controllers` directory.

              (9) From the source file you identified in step (7) above, copy over:
              
              * all of the imports
              * the  `@WebMvcTest(...)` annotation (be sure to change the parameter here to the name of the controller test you are testing; forgetting to do so is a common source of errors)
              * the `@Import(TestConfig.class)` annotation (this one stays exactly as it is)
              * the `@MockBean` declaration for the repository for your new database table; this creates a "mock" (i.e. "fake") database object using a Java package called `Mockito`)
              * the `@MockBean` declaration for the `UserRepository`; this is needed so that we can work with the mock users to test what happens in various scenarios: user not logged in, regular user logged in, admin user logged in
              
              Be sure to change the name of the controller class to match the one for your database table.

              (10) Next, copy over just the tests that pertain to the methods you defined in your controller so far, i.e. the ones under the comments:
              * `// Tests for GET /api/ucsbdiningcommons/all`
              * `// Tests for POST /api/ucsbdiningcommons...`

              You'll see additional tests for another `GET` method, as well as `DELETE` and `PUT`; we don't want
              those tests yet (that's a later issue).

              (11) Check test coverage with `mvn test jacoco:report`; to read the report, open `target/site/jacoco/index.html` in a web browser. Iterate until you have 100% line/branch coverage.
              
              (12) Check test coverage with `mvn test pitest:mutationCoverage`; to read the report, open `target/pit-reports/index.html` in a web browser. Iterate until there are no surviving mutations (e.g. `>> Generated 61 mutations Killed 61 (100%)`).  You may ignore line coverage of less than 100% reported by pitest (e.g. this is fine: `>> Line Coverage: 171/175 (98%)`).

              # Acceptance Criteria:

              - [ ] There is a controller file `${{env.name}}Controller.java`
                in the expected directory.
              - [ ] In `${{env.name}}Controller.java` there is 
                code for a `GET /api/${{env.name}}/all` endpoint 
                that returns a JSON list of all `${{env.name}}`s in the database.
                (We sometimes call this an *index* action since it lists all
                items in the database.)
              - [ ] In `${{env.name}}Controller.java` there is 
                code for a `POST /api/${{env.name}}/post` endpoint
                that can be used to create a new entry in the table. (This
                is a *create* action.)
              - [ ] The Swagger-UI endpoints for these are well documented so that
                any member of the team can understand what they are for and
                how to use them.
              - [ ] The `POST` endpoint works as expected, in the sense that new
                records can be added to the database (on localhost).
              - [ ] The `GET` endpoint works as expected, in the sense that the new
                records that are added show up (on localhost).
              - [ ] The `GET` and `POST` endpoints work as expected when the 
                app is deployed to Dokku.
              - [ ] There is full test coverage (Jacoco) for the methods in 
                `${{env.name}}Controller.java`
              - [ ] There is full mutation test coverage (Pitest) for the methods in
                `${{env.name}}Controller.java`

            Note that while it isn't strictly necessary, it may be a good idea to implement `GET` for a single item
            first; when using `PUT` manually, it's convenient to be able to copy/paste the JSON representation of the data from the
            `GET` by id method, paste it into the swagger interface, then edit it to make the changes you want before clicking to
            submit the request.
            
            You'll need to copy over the code for the PUT method from the example controller,
