Instructions: <https://ucsb-cs156.github.io/f23/lab/team02.html>

TODO: change heading above to your repo name, e.g. `# team02-f23-6pm-4`

TODO: Add a link to the deployed Dokku app for your team here, e.g.

Deployments:

- Prod: <https://team02.dokku-17.cs.ucsb.edu>
- QA: <https://team02-qa.dokku-17.cs.ucsb.edu>

# Setup before running application

Before running the application for the first time,
you need to do the steps documented in [`docs/oauth.md`](docs/oauth.md).

Otherwise, when you try to login for the first time, you
will likely see an error such as:

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1119017/149858436-c9baa238-a4f7-4c52-b995-0ed8bee97487.png" alt="Authorization Error; Error 401: invalid_client; The OAuth client was not found." width="400"/>

# Getting Started on localhost

- Open _two separate terminal windows_
- In the first window, start up the backend with:
  ```
  mvn spring-boot:run
  ```
- In the second window:
  ```
  cd frontend
  npm install  # only on first run or when dependencies change
  npm start
  ```

Then, the app should be available on <http://localhost:8080>

If it doesn't work at first, e.g. you have a blank page on <http://localhost:8080>, give it a minute and a few page refreshes. Sometimes it takes a moment for everything to settle in.

If you see the following on localhost, make sure that you also have the frontend code running in a separate window.

```
Failed to connect to the frontend server... On Dokku, be sure that PRODUCTION is defined.  On localhost, open a second terminal window, cd into frontend and type: npm install; npm start";
```

# Getting Started on Dokku

See: [/docs/dokku.md](/docs/dokku.md)

# Accessing swagger

To access the swagger API endpoints, use:

- <http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html>

Or add `/swagger-ui/index.html` to the URL of your dokku deployment.

# To run React Storybook

- cd into frontend
- use: npm run storybook
- This should put the storybook on http://localhost:6006
- Additional stories are added under frontend/src/stories

- For documentation on React Storybook, see: https://storybook.js.org/

# SQL Database access

On localhost:

- The SQL database is an H2 database and the data is stored in a file under `target`
- Each time you do `mvn clean` the database is completely rebuilt from scratch
- You can access the database console via a special route, <http://localhost:8080/h2-console>
- For more info, see [docs/h2-database.md](/docs/h2-database.md)

On Dokku, follow instructions for Dokku databases:

- <https://ucsb-cs156.github.io/topics/dokku/postgres_database.html>
